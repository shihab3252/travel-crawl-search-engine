We ran the hills of smaller mountains nearby & trained vigorously for about a month & in early September ended up free soloing & summiting The Grand Teton. Growing up, I was a huge video game nerd & rarely left the house. Now I spend my days traveling the country in my camper van, practicing mindfulness, & appreciating nature.

A Royal Marine from the North of England on his journey solo riding through through the Northern States of India on a 400cc Royal Enfield Himalayan.\n\nBradley took himself to the North of India, drawn in by the landscape and the terrain. Some of the hardest motorable roads on the planet lay ahead of him. But as time passes, it was the human connections, and memories formed with the people he met. It was these moments that made his travels one to remember.\n\nHaving said that, between the extreme altitudes, and the army activity in relation to Kashmir.. I have a feeling Bradley came into many more situations than a few casual conversations..\n\nIf you're interested, head on over to the article and let me know what you think! I'm super new at interviews and writing article, so would love to have your feedback. Do you think I covered his story nicely, or am I missing anything I should work towards on future similar pieces?

Most useful I'd say was our mini propane stove and a cheap pot. We cooked so many hot meals that made the trip a thousand times better than if we had to eat dry and cold meals. Rice was a close second, since its cheap and adds so much to any freeze dried meal. Just add some rice and its twice as nice!\n\nMost useless is a little harder, we had a few candidates. Our tent, as we discovered a bit too late, had lost its waterproof seal from years of wear and tear, so we wound up getting rained on for 3 days in a more remote part of the countryside. Our solar phone chargers also proved to be ineffective during said storm. And I don't think we ever used our playing cards once. \nBut I'm probably gonna have to give it to our tent, because other than that disaster 3 day camping excursion, we never used it since the hiking trail we trekked on had public huts for bunking, and everywhere else we stayed in hostels.", "As I said, it's hard to pick favorites, but the climax of the trip was definitely our 33km hike around The Routeburn Track. It's a 3 day trip through Fjordland National Park and the scenery was nothing short of majestic beauty around every bend. And with ~35lbs on our backs, every stop was rewarding when we could put our packs down and enjoy some freeze dried meals in the huts that were placed at each major stopping point along the trail.", "Even though I've never seen the movies, Ethan was always a huge LOTR fan. Our sophomore year of high school we were staying in a hotel for some kind of vacation, when he started talking about this dream he had of taking a backpacking trip to New Zealand. It sounded crazy to me then, but a little over 3 years later and we went and did it!\n\nIts hard to pick favorites, but staying with our WWOOFing hosts was particularly lovely. They treated us like regular family, served us homemade meals with food fresh from the farm, and even took us to a big family gathering at the end of the week. \n\nThe climax of the trip though was definitely our 3-day hike around the Routeburn Track. It's a 33km trail through the Fjordland national park. A good portion of the trail is just walking on the sides of mountains above, or in the clouds. One of the many lakes along the trail is the one pictured above. (Edit, spelling)", "Ethan and I saved for almost a year I think, we had budgeted around 3k US dollars each and spent about 2.5 in the end (including airfare). \n\nWhat helped a TON was WWOOFing. Its a work-in-exchange-for-accommodations program that's really popular in NZ particularly. We worked 1 week on our hosts' farm out of the 4 weeks we spent there, and would've gladly stayed longer if our schedule had allowed. \n\nBiggest thing for us when budgeting was planning for the worst case scenario, than adding a little cusion on top of that. Both of us were $500 dollars under budget in the end, but if we had had an emergency out there, that's money we would've been glad to have. I also had a credit card for an absolute emergency.\n\nWe also laid out our entire trip on a google document that we both could access from anywhere. We were constantly updating it with new information as we got closer to our trip. It had our budget, our schedule and itinerary, the gear we would need, updates on the WWOOFing situation, everything relevant so that neither of us were in the dark. \n\nSorta went on a couple of tangents but hopefully that information proves useful. \ud83d\ude04", "Oh that's not too bad!", "Not at all!

I moved to Wyoming, bought an dilapidated house for $18,000, remodeled, and 18 months later, sold it and left on what ended up being a 3-year trip around the world. I went solo, but of course I met people all along the way. About year into it, I found myself in South Africa and got a job working for a construction crew. Eight months later, I saw a 3x5 card on a board, looking for crew to sail a boat out around Madagascar for 3 months. I met the captain and 3 weeks later, me and a couple other guys in their 20s took off out of Durban. Many stories to tell, including a Force 9 storm that turtled us twice, but this image shows one of the hightlights. Ask any questions, and I'll respond.", "My bad explanation.

I'll keep looking, but really, any book that shares the type of experiences you want will do. Had I known the world that awaited by sailing, I would do it that way now. There's kind of an undergound sailing world where you can go to pretty much any island and hang out near the yacht harbor where world-traveling sailboats come and go, and they're always losing sailors and needing to pick up fresh mates. Or you could pick a region (Turkey, or New Zealand, Southeast Asia, Laos) and find books that explain how to travel into the back country there. The key is to start the plan and put a date of departure down on the calendar. And whatever you do, don't come back for a minimum of 6 months, ideally a year.

To this day it is the darkest night I have ever experienced. So dark bats couldn't fly. Well that's not quite true, but definitely no birds could navigate that night.  \nSo dark that even though we knew where the old tree stumps were above the serface we could not see them from 4 ft away. We would bump into them before we saw them, even though my buddy was in the front of the boat.  \n   It was a combination of frustration and wonder trying to fish. Usually you can't see your lure when you are retrieving it. That night you couldn't see your lure at the ned of the rod. To have \"the right amount of line\" from your lure ot your rod to cast correctly you could just look and see. Not this night. We had to hold our rod tip a certain(guess) distance from the surface, and when the lure came out of the water you stopped reeling and could cast.  \n  Not knowing or seeing the lure/line made the cast direction a guess.  \n Frustrating.  \n  On one cast I was hung in the bushes up on the bank. My buddy patiently wait for me to pull the canoe to my lure (because we couldn't see where it was that was the only option.  \n  This time the lure was caught in a tree so high I had to stand in the canoe to reach it....and as I stretched out my arm to gingerly wrap my hand around the lure without getting hooked I was surrounded by somethign. The whole upper half of my body was immersed in soft warm collapse of fabric, It slid up my body. it felt like the devil was breathing on me. All the thoughts went through my head and only a few were processed. The first was of a hornets nest. I though perhaps the hornets all fell out of the entranve and had tumbled as one down over me,,,and were trying to rake flight..I waited for the pain of the stings to come...but at almost the same time a deep guttural scream rang out very close, it ressonated in my ears.  \n I was frozen. I couldn't go anywhere...or move an inch..I was standing in a canoe in the dark.. had my lure come free from the tree limb I would have surely tipped the canoe over.  \n And then within a second it was gone. And I just stood there balancing. My friend didn't move. He didn't say a word. I wondered where i was. or he was. Still my mind raced... was I alive.... no sound no sight floating on a pond in pitched black darkness.  \nAnd then the same guttural scream, out over the lake. From that distance I had heard it before.  \n   A great Blue heron.  \nIt took some seconds to settle enough to think what had happened. That the devil hadn't come to take me home. That it was just so dark that a Great Blue Heron was in the same predicament as we were...he couldn't see his beak in front of his eyes. So when the tree limb rustled and woke him he sat tight. And I slid quietly and unseen up to him sitting out on a limb, where he felt safe over the lake. But finally his nerves got the best of him...either I said something, or he could feel a large something coming towards him.   \n he hopped off of that limb with his breast and voicebox right over my head by inches, and downstroked his four foot long wings around me, encasing me...and let out that \"SQWAAAAK\". Every single iota of stimulation was of that...It ws if I was in a deprivation tank and then someone let the devil in to say \"HELLOoooo.\"  \n   We fished a little while longer, it was useless.", "My friends and I went sailing in the Gulf of Mexico.  In a small raft.  At night.  In not ideal wind conditions.  We were dumb and adventurous teenagers.\n\nNot too far in (maybe a mile or two offshore) the girl in our group ended up falling out of the boat (the waves flipped it upside down and when we flipped it back over, she was 15 feet away from the boat and we were being carried away)\n\nWe lost her for a little while, sailing around trying to find her.  First my brave friend jumped in with a life jacket.  The boat was pulled away from them and we lost them for a little while.  Then we found her again and my friend wasn't in sight.  So me, being dumb, jumped out of the boat to help without a life jacket.  When I got to her and realized what I had done, we started swimming back to the boat.   I left her behind to swim faster and get a life jacket.  When I was about 10 feet away the boat tipped over and floated back to shore, and I was alone.  Her brother was still on the boat though.\n\nHonestly I can't make sense of how three of us jumped out of the boat and ended up separated but the seas must have drifted us apart.\n\nI hadn't swum in years but I did learn that treading water in the middle of the ocean is a lot harder than swimming in the pool.  I was about to go off to Marine boot camp in the next week (probably part of the reason I had the idea to do this in the first place) and decided to view it as training.  However I started losing hope about 30 minutes in as my legs started to cramp up.  I started bargaining with God that I would become a priest if he let me live.  Then not long after I realized that in 12 hours I would either be safe OR dead so it didn't really matter what happened now because it would only be temporary.\n\nAfter about an hour of treading water (or what seemed like an hour) I hit a sand bar.  I could stand!  On top of that, the current was pushing me towards the beach (which was not something I knew would happen).  I was still miles out but I could rest my legs.  I thanked God.  As the current pushed me back into deeper water I eventually had to start treading water again but now I had a lot more hope.\n\nMaybe 20 minutes later I found another sand bar and heard my friends!  They (Jack and Jill, for privacy purposes) had found each other.  Jack had given Jill his life vest and they were swimming back to shore.  I was elated and I started swimming towards them.  From then on the story isn't exciting because we just spent 2 hours paddling back to shore while clinging onto one life vest.  By then Jill's brother had made it back to shore and had called the police so my friends talked to them for a while, while I sat in the car for an hour and was eaten alive by bugs.  The coast guard had been called but the helicopter didn't show up until after we had made it to shore.

When the lightning and thunder are happening at the exact same time, and the realization that sitting on a rubber raft in the middle of the river is the safest spot to be while you wait for the world to split in half. Wind, rain, hail, thunder so loud it feels like it's coming from inside your head, and nowhere to go except downriver into the darkness of the storm.\n\nAnd then 20 minutes later it was over, the sun was out, the adrenaline and endorphin rush was subsiding, and we had an amazing rainbow pulling into camp.

It was fucking terrifying. Entire trees floating downriver, we all had mild hypothermia, Class III and IV rapids became fucking monsters with house-sized standing waves, no fish to be had... but, young and stupid as we were, we continued on (we had no way to call for help pre-cell days and no way to get off the river). \n\nAll four of us survived, with one broken wrist and we lost a canoe for real somewhere in the Lower Gorge and got rescued by Park service folks below the bridge. Our parents were fucking horrified, and the local news had run stories about the boys lost on the river...\n\nAbsolutely epic fucking fun that I fondly think back to not infrequently.

I spent 2 days in a fishing village recovering.", "Having to navigate downtown paris on foot in the rain with no phone data trying to find the GD metro because the physical map with the metro stations you got was shit.\n\nIts such a good memory but man i was salty at the time", "(TL;DR at bottom)\n\nI live in Wales, in the UK.\nIt was winter when this story took place, and it got dark super early.\nMy partner and I fancied a stroll up one of the easiest mountain paths near us, we invited a friend along, but although we agreed to meet him at the base of the mountain, we couldn\u2019t find him as there was no phone signal in the area.\nIt turns out he had borrowed his mother\u2019s car and we hadn\u2019t realised he had arrived before us. After an half an hour or so of waiting for him, we decided to make the climb as we had no idea where he was and we could not get in contact. By this point it was about 4pm.\nAs this is a fairly easy hike we didn\u2019t need any equipment or bags of any sort, it usually takes an hour or so to get to the top, so we went up in our casual gear, only to find our friend on his way down from the top at about 1/4 of the way up. We were pretty annoyed as we\u2019d been waiting for so long and it was starting to get dark, but we all agreed to catch up later after my partner and I had done the walk. At about halfway up, the sky had turned into a really dark grey colour, the wind picked up considerably, and it was almost completely dark.\nIt had been a while since we\u2019d last done the hike, so that last stretch of mountain seemed to take forever, and it didn\u2019t help that we could only see a few feet in front of us and the faint silhouette of the mountaintop in the distance. It was about 3/4 of the way up when the light reached pitch black and it started to snow and hail.\nNow the ascent doesn\u2019t seem so steep when you\u2019re walking up the mountain, so it didn\u2019t feel so bad putting one foot in front of the other in the pitch black, it\u2019s a pretty safe path at the end of the day. However it was just before we reached the peak that we knew we had to turn back. The sleet was literally whipping our faces, even though I wrapped my scarf around my face, I kept having to close my eyes, just so that the hail wouldn\u2019t smack into them so often. We reached one of the first flat points of the mountain and the wind almost swept us away (we\u2019re both quite small).\nThe descent down was the part that we hated. By this point it was incredibly cold (for what we were wearing), the sleet was attacking our faces, and the wind made us feel increasingly unsteady, not to mention it was pitch black and we were going downhill.\nMy partner used the torch on his phone to illuminate the path ahead, but after a little while his phone died on us. We started to use my phone to do the same and I watched as each minute the battery drained further. It was just before we got to the bottom that it finally died, and I can only imagine what on earth we looked like at the end as we fumbled our way, essentially blind, at the end of the path back to our car.\n\nLooking back, we both have fond memories of that time we tried to walk that path, it was pretty dumb attempting it in the dark, and the wind and rain were really not pleasant at the top. But we love telling our friend off for starting the journey without us and we got a fun story out of it.\n\nTL;DR\nMy boyfriend and I had to wait to start a mountain hike due to a mate of ours essentially not meeting us on time. At the top it got super windy, it started to hail and sleet, and it got really dark really quickly, both our phones ran out of battery and we had to walk blindly back down the path, but for some reason we look back fondly at the memory", "My wife and I decided to go camping for our anniversary, one of those really nice campsites that aren't too far from civilization. But when we arrived, we realized that we forgot to bring cookware, so we got back in our car and drove to general store after general store looking for cookware. When we finally found some, we realized that our car battery had died. We tried to get a jump from multiple people, but it never worked. We had to call a tow truck to take us back to the campsite to get our stuff, but it took the tow truck four hours to arrive, so we just sat at the nearby restaurant getting completely hammered.", "My first backpacking trip- a slight chance of rain when we left for the trailhead became the storm of the century overnight, and we had to cover a lot of distance in a pretty short amount of time to get back to our car.  I overpacked, our campsite was not in the best spot, water was scarce, and my dumb ass forgot I was allergic to poison ivy (I'd been leaning on a memory of having been told that our family didn't get it.)  My socks hiking back weren't wool, so my feet chafed like hell.  It took me a couple weeks to feel normal after that- I even had to get steroids to clear up the poison ivy.  All in all, though, one of the most transcendent experiences I've had.  I've been wanting to go again for ages.", "My first backpacking trip was the 96 mile Wonderland trail around Mount Rainier in Washington. We did it in six nights and there's something like 20,000 feet of elevation change throughout the hike. Most of it was miserable. In retrospect it seems like it was fun. I wouldn't do it again though.", "Was in Indonesia at this crater where you're supposed to be able to see \"blue fire\" due to sulfur combustion inside the crater. You go when it's darkest to try to be able to see it best. So at 2 AM we hike in probably about six miles, all uphill to get to the good spot. At some point we are given gas masks to help with the stench of sulfur gas all around you. \n\nAs we were getting closer, we notice the wind (basically sulfur fog) starting to kick up & get thicker around us. At some point it was pretty hard to see and the smell had gotten so terrible. We thought nothing of it as they had given us the gas masks and everyone seemed to be going about their business. Mind you, this is not a very organized tourist attraction.\n\n So we get down into the crater where there are sulfur miners everywhere carrying big loads of sulfur out on their backs. And as we climb down into the crater the gas began to get so, so bad- making our eyes water, making it hard to even breathe. Got to the bottom and could barely see the blue fire, definitely not enough to get a picture. We had lost our guide a ways back, and at one point on the way out I lost track of everyone and was on my own. I could barely even see my hand in front of me. Eventually made it out after quite a bit of stress. Find out the next day it is shut down for the next to weeks due to severe weather. It was awful at the time, but still one of my favorite stories to tell!", "Spent a 12 hour day skiing La Plata Peak in Colorado last January. It's not a particularly hard or long peak; it was just one of those days. One small issue after another building upon each other up, up, and up--an impending lego tower of doom.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFirst, it was really fucking cold when the snow plow woke me up at 5 am. Now, the back of my Land Rover is fairly comfortable with my large sleeping pad and 0F sleeping bag; however, wow, it was cold. The plows were loud and bright. I fell back asleep twice, waking up each time the plow came by. By the time I got up, ate breakfast, organized my gear, doggo, it was after 8am. There was a trench already, so I followed it. There was deep fresh snow in the trees, so I wasn't keen on breaking trail. With my periodic GPS checks, I could see the trench wasn't exactly on the right path, but ok, this guy must have known right? People around here are generally pretty serious and knowledgeable about these routes; they don't even consider winter summits unless they already know what they're doing. This track gets quite steep and slick also. My skins keep sliding backwards. Eventually, I run into the guy who made the trench. He made it to the headwall, but said he got pretty lost. This trench doesn't go quite the right way. Now, I'm forced to start breaking trail and check my gps more often. That means cold fingers and slower pace. Eventually I pull up to the headwall with another party. A skier along with his green friend rocking boots and crampons, in multiple feet of fresh snow. We climb the headwall together; I basically pull/carry my dog up it. From here its a 2-3 miles ridge slog.", "I like the way you write", "So I just read this whole thing and have no idea what happened.

I truly believe however, that travel  should be viewed like what it used to be in the past: A means of educating oneself and a possible way of life. I know there are already people out there who still view it as such, but the vast majority doesn't and sees it as impossible to have as a lifestyle. \n\nI truly believe we can bridge the gap between our different biases by experiencing each others cultures. We won\u2019t be able to experience the world as someone but a different bias, but we can always make our view more accurate. This is what I have set as one of my life\u2019s goals.\n\nI also believe in the lessons nature can teach us and the way this can help us advance both mentally as well as physically. Just think of the plethora of inventions that have been inspired by nature.\n\nBut to cut to the main body of my story and request:\n\nMy friend and I are planning to lead a life of adventure with the goal of looking for both historical as well as scientific knowledge. Our scope is going to be the whole world, with our main form of transportation being a boat. A catamaran to be precise, which I'm designing myself.\n\nEven though we have set specific goals, the main goal is the adventure this will bring. This in itself being a vault of knowledge filled with personal development and experiences. We will be doing this for the personal wealth of experience and development this brings and the incidental wealth of knowledge this will bring the whole world. \n\nWe plan on being self sufficient by means of gathering things ourselves or when we come in contact with local people by providing services or trading for the things we might need. Using money will only be for the direst circumstances and we will abstain from the use of it when we can.\n\nWe are well aware that this will not come without risk, but we\u2019ll try to manage that to the best of our abilities. In my opinion, if you\u2019re not willing to risk something in order to get what you want from life at one point, you will most likely regret not having taken a shot for the rest of it. Key is the way you manage the risk. Having only this life here cuts both ways; Don\u2019t rashly throw it away, but don\u2019t waste it either. I've already said that I'm a nearly graduated mechanical engineer and that I don\u2019t want to work a 40 hour per week job in office. I\u2019d much rather use my knowledge and apply it to a more adventurous cause which might be able to benefit the whole world, instead of just one company and a consumerist culture. I'm, however, not hiding the fact that this is in the first place inspired by a personal  and somewhat selfish desire to live life out this way.\n\nBoth of us are already planning and we already have a few potential endeavours lined up, with our first one already decided. We are also continuously looking into the many facets this prolonged expedition will encompass, out of which survival techniques are the most important. \n\nThe idea is to make this our life. We do not plan on moving back and forth between the expeditions and temporary retirement in society.\n\nWe are looking for like-minded individuals with a similar passion to join us, because we know that we can\u2019t do this alone. Happiness in what you do is only worthwhile when you can share it with like-minded individuals and help each other out along the way. We know we\u2019re a tad crazy for doing so, but we know there are other people like us out there and are trying to reach out in this fashion.\n\nOf course I haven\u2019t been able to shed light on all the parts of this expedition, but if anyone is interested please P.M me. I would be more than happy to clear up anything and provide you with more information pertaining to the whole endeavour as well as the people involved. \n\nI also know that there will probably be quite some criticism as to what we are planning, but I welcome any constructive criticism. We can\u2019t all agree, but we can still learn from each other, so everyone\u2019s opinion is welcome.\n\nTL;DR: Me and my friend are planning on leaving the safety society behind to lead an adventurous life in search of knowledge encompassing the entire globe. Currently we are looking for like-minded individuals to join us. \n\nUPDATE (30-10-2013): \nI'm really grateful for all your comments and support. It really warms my heart =)\n\nI'd like to clarify that we won't leave until a few years from now. We plan to leave in 2017.\n\nOne thing I would like to clarify as well are the finances for the boat: \nYou don't need to contribute financially in order to be eligible to join, everyone will contribute in their own way and once we leave money will be moot anyway. Just because me and my friend decide to finance it doesn't mean that anyone that wants to join has to as well. In our eyes money should and will never be a requirement, because it will be detrimental to the spirit of this adventure.\n\nUPDATE (06-03-2014)\nIt has been a while since I last updated the status of our plans. In the meantime things have been progressing really well though. We have decided on restoring a catamaran/trimaran instead of building one from scratch, so we will have more time to prepare our other skills. \n\nAt the moment our group consists of seven people, so we won't be actively recruiting any more. We would still love to hear from everyone that is interested though and we would more than appreciate anyone willing to help out. Perhaps even tag along for legs of our journey in the future or join when any positions open up. \n\nWe aren't yet making things public though, for that reason we have set up a private Facebook group which anyone that is interested can join until we put up something more public when we get closer to setting off on our adventure. \n\nLet me know and I'll send the link to the group, where you can stay in touch with us for now.\n\nUPDATE (15-09-2014)\nAlso check out my most recent post about our new vision for our group structure: http://www.reddit.com/r/adventures/comments/2e2tbx/the_makings_of_a_life_of_adventure_birth_of_a/", "id": "1pbfg3", "image": "https://www.reddit.com/r/adventures/comments/1pbfg3/a_life_of_adventure/", "num_comments": 41, "link": "/r/adventures/comments/1pbfg3/a_life_of_adventure/", "upvotes": 32, "comments": ["I support this lifestyle 100% and I am looking to start living this way in 1.5 years, when I have finished my degree.

It's always nice to know we're not lonely islands floating in the ocean. We plan on leaving at the start of 2017. \n\nWe aren't intending on letting everyone pay for the boat, each person contributes in his own way. After we leave, money won't mean much anyway. \n\nFunnily enough the friend I mention is from Norway and after my graduation I'm going to move to Norway as well. I'll definitely take you up on your offer sometime ;)", "I hope so too, it's always nice to meet kindred spirits. Your assumption is wrong though, I'm from Europe as well ;) \n\nIt's nice to know I'm not the only one \"crazy\" enough to think outside of the box in such a fashion. Everyone has something different that will grant them happiness and purpose in their life. Especially because of my current read-through of Ibn Battuta's Travels am I convinced that it is not only a feasible lifestyle, but also the one for me.\n\nI'd love to know about your experience though, so don't be a stranger.

You can always have adventures, they only get bigger when you get older I suppose. \n\nI plan on doing so and by reading Walking the Amazon have been made aware of the Rite in the Rain notebooks, which I will surely make use of.

Albeit people are very unlikely to enter the ships ballast tanks or chain locker while exploring, but going into the interior parts of the vessel such as the engine room or cargo holds still pose the same dangers. The principle being is that these are spaces completely enclosed by steel. Key word is the steel. When it oxidizes, the steel itself absorbs the ambient oxogen content from the air as it rusts. In normal operation this never poses too much of a danger because these spaces are being continuously ventilated (minus the cargo holds). Yet evidently, sitting abandoned these systems in place are no longer in operation. I do not want to the the voice saying exploring is dangerous and never should be done, but I seriously advise to invest in an atmospheric monitering device if you want to explore any enclosed space.\n\nTLDR, Ships are not like concrete bunkers or buildings.

We were walking down a path that had bridges across it every mile or so and we set up a small camp under a bridge that was well away from civilisation so as to not attract any unwanted attention, this is where 2 of my friends decided to have a little friendly competition to see who was the better shot. \nIt's also where I got hit in my right arm by the guy who owned the guns and was supposed to have been hunting with his grandfather all the time as a kid, as soon as I felt the pellet hit me I knew what had happened but my first thought was \"oh fuck I've been shot\" so I just kinda threw myself at the floor near my bag so I could grab something to stop the bleeding. \nThe pellet took a decent chunk of flesh but didn't get stuck in my arm so I washed the blood of with some water and wiped the wound with an antibacterial wipe I had in my first aid kit then wrapped it with some cotton wool and bandages.\nBy the time my friends got to me (probably about a minute after I got hit, like 2 mins tops) I was on the floor with my sleeve rolled up, bandage around my arm and a cigarette in my mouth, they couldn't help but laugh and remind me that I wasn't in the Vietnam war.\nAll in all it wasn't a bad day but if I hadn't been carrying clean water and my first aid kit I could have gotten an infection which is the last thing I wanted to deal with during a warm summer.\n\nTl;Dr - got pegged in the arm with a metal pellet by my jackass friend when we were 16 and ended up looking like I was having another 'nam flashback after I cleaned and dressed the wound.

I hadn't booked a guide because I felt confident after a few climbs that week, and thought the tour operator was trying to scaremonger me into paying for a guide when I was on a Shoestring budget. I left at night in order to be at the summit for sunrise. As the first light started seeping through I got anxious to make it to the top and lost my trail. I went too far to the wrong side of the volcano (full of ash and rubble) and climbed to a point where it was dangerous to go further up, and dangerous to go back down. \n\n\nI was there for two days, almost dying of dehydration /heatstroke in the day/hypothermia at night. Hallucinations started happening. I resigned myself to the fate that I couldn't make it, used my last energy to climb up an embankment, and used an LED to shine towards the nearest town at night as an emergency beacon. There's more to the story, but the next morning some rice farmers came after seeing my signals and carried me 4 hours down a valley to their homes. \n\n\nLessons I learnt : be less reckless. Having 'views to yourself' does not make up for risking your life on naive inexperience. Trust people more experienced than you, pack more water, tell people where you're going, and listen to your instinct when things get tense. ", "Maybe cross post in r/campingandhiking", "Not a life-threatening emergency, but could easily have had a much worse outcome:\n\nA couple of years back I was living in Africa. My mate and I decided to go rock-climbing with a couple of other, more experienced, guys. The approach included half a day's drive, the last half hour or so of which was up the side of this table mountain. So it was a good thing that one of the guys had a 4WD jeep. Once we reached the end of the dirt road, it was approx another 2 hours hike through pathless swamp and Highland moors until we reached the rocks we were planning to climb: a nice series of cliffs jutting out of the moor. Of course it had been raining heavily for half the day, because it just wouldn't have sufficed to only be drenched from down below (pathless swamp, remember?). \n\nFortunately the rain ceased during the night and the next morning was beautiful and sunny. We quickly scouted the cliffs while warming up; the (volcanic) rock was reasonably dry and I found a spot that I deemed worthy of being my first first ascent - I didn't mention that we were the first people ever to climb there, did I?\n\nWell, I successfully ascended. It was perhaps a 4b/4c in French grades, so really easy, but it took me ages to make my way up because I was so nervous :-D \nMy friend was even less confident than me, so I set up a top rope up there. And it was a lucky thing I did. After I was safely down on solid ground again, I belayed him up about half way - that's when he grabbed this huge flake of rock with both hands and put his whole weight on it. The whole thing came out of the wall, almost in slow motion, but still, there was nothing he could do: It hit both his legs, whisked him away and tumbled to the ground; all, I don't know, 50kg of it. \n\nHadn't he been on top rope, but rather leading the route, things could have been much worse. Firstly, I'd have been standing closer to the wall - right about where the rock came down. Secondly, it would have picked up more speed before hitting him, probably breaking his legs. As it was, he got away merely with two huge, freely bleeding gashes in both his shins. \n\nHe was in shock, of course, shaking and laughing madly the whole time while we performed first aid and brewed him tea. As this was in Africa, we decided that calling a rescue helicopter would probably take too long, and the bandages were doing a good job of stopping the bleeding, so we talked him into walking back to the car right away. Of course this was the moment the weather chose to turn sour again! About half way down, a nearly solid fog crept up on us, and it didn't take long until we were hopelessly lost. After walking in circles for perhaps 20 minutes, my friend (fortunately recovering from the shock and thinking more clearly) remembered that his camera had a GPS function and recorded the coordinates of each photo - and luckily he had taken a picture of the car! So we took some more pictures and used the coordinates to calculate the direction the jeep was in. With that information it was easy to navigate back by compass. \n\nWe found the car, drove back down and a couple of hours to the nearest town, which had a small country hospital. We jumped queue in front of all the poor farmers and mothers with crying babies like colonialist arseholes, and got his legs stitched back up. I daresay he still has some epic scars to remember that story by! \n\n\n\nLessons learned: 1. always pack the First Aid kit, and 2. learn to navigate in a fog!

I figure I should write it all out and post on here to get as much information from you guys as I possibly can, and to share with you guys what I'll be going through.  \n  \n**Backstory**\n  \nTo start off, I'm a 6'4, 26 year old male with no real obligations.  I've lived a decent life up until this point, but I've never been away from my hometown for longer than two months.  Because of this, I feel that I never really have gotten to know who I really am.  I've had mediocre grades throughout my life, and have completed around 60 transferable college units at a community college.  Because of recent stresses and events in my life, I took to a realization that I've been having a pretty consistent battle about the reason for existence and the value of being alive (I'm by no means suicidal, but its hard for me to be motivated without finding a reason to be).  So, in order for me to get out of my bad habits and to answer the hard deep questions I have about life, I've decided to sell everything I don't need and hit the open road!  \n  \n**About the trip!**  \n  \nAs of right now, I'm in the process of selling my car and purchasing a motorcycle!  I have a few months to save up enough money for food and camping permits.  I'll definitely need to talk to some of you guys about advice with gear, places to see, and the best places to do some stealth camping.  \n  \nI have a general guideline of spots that I want to hit, and it involves traveling in a counterclockwise direction of the US perimeter.  That being said, I want to leave most of my locations to recommendations of locals and friends.  I plan on having 2k in the bank for gas, food, and hostels/motels if there's nowhere to camp.  Most of the nights I plan on camping on the side of the road if I can find a place to hide my bike (which probably isn't legal, but eh...).  I've looked into couch surfing and I'm going to try and utilize it as much as I can for the bigger cities.  \n  \n**My Goal/Objective!**\n  \n*To roam the countryside and cities of North America, learning as much as I can about people, culture, life, and myself.  To connect with nature and the spirit of Earth, and to live not only in the universe, but also with it.  To discover what makes existence so improbable, yet tangible.  To find meaning in life outside of human relationships, whilst also not neglecting the importance of companionship.  To challenge myself physically, mentally, and emotionally in a search to feel strong.  To seperate myself from the luxuries and commodities of a modern life, and to focus my efforts on helping others rather than myself.  To be more open with myself and others, as well as situational opportunities.  And lastly, to improve myself so that I can become who I'm supposed to be.*  \n  \nI really am excited to share all of this with you, albeit I won't be leaving until early February.

Good luck!", "Man I wish I was you! I took a two week 1300 mile adventure through the Adirondacks and vermont camping along the way and it was a blast!! Tip if you're worried about wildlife (bears) poking around your tent ( I was a little nervous at times). I would park my bike right next to the entrance of my tent and leave the keys in the ignition and in neutral so if I was awoken by unwelcome visitors I could quickly start my bike and scare the piss out of them. Never had any problems but it was a nice sense of security. Also don't forget to leave your food items away from camp!  I always left my stuff 1000+ feet away from my tent. ", "That is truly awesome man.  If you plan on visiting any mountain range in central/southern california, I'd be happy to throw in some knowledge for you brother.", "I wasn't on a bike, but I once spent 76 days just driving around North America.  I started in Alaska, headed down the west coast into Mexico, then back up into Arizona and to Miami, then up to Portland, Maine, then across the Midwest (Ann Arbor, Madison, and Lexington, Kentucky), and then back up home to Alaska.\n\nI camped on the side of the road almost every night, and never had a problem.  It is amazingly easy to camp pretty much anywhere (except California).  And if you find yourself in National Forest land, you can camp almost anywhere without permits.\n\nI only ever thought I was going to have trouble once, and that was when I was camping on the beach in Oregon (where it's legal to drive on the beach).  I had my tent set up next to my car up as far from the water as I could be near the bluff.  At about 2AM a couple local drunks in a huge pick-up truck came down to the beach and started revving their engine, speeding around, and doing donuts.  I woke up, and was slightly worried.  Then they started driving right towards my tent, and I got really worried.  They pulled next to the tent and yelled, \"Is somebody in there?\"  I mustered my biggest tough guy voice and yelled, \"YES!\"  And that point they said, \"We're sorry man, we didn't see you were sleeping; we're going to go somewhere else, have a good night!\"", "I've wanted to do a trip like this for so long. Years. 27 years old now, and working a position I love, so it's looking hazy if I will ever do it. Check out advrider.com/forums/ this website is dedicated to those doing exactly what you are doing. People take trips like these for undetermined amounts of time, and write ride reports and post there. They have a tent space where people post places to crash (like couch surfing, but only for members of that website). Check it out, and keep us updated!", "I did about the same thing 2 years ago.  5 month / 16000 mile road trip on a motorcycle around the US.   Camped much of the time, which is a great way to meet people, really see the country, and not spend too much money on the ride.   Follow your dreams!  \n\nOnly thing I would say, and by no means to discourage you, but this isn't the best time to head around a lot of the US on motorcycle.  I don't know how long you plan to be gone (2k won't last forever, sadly).  But most of the north is starting to get cold and will have snowy days over higher roads before too too long.  Just be careful and plan accordingly (cold weather gear is KEY to motocamping and riding).  But of course much of the US is rideable year round, so you'll always have options.

I've never heard of the Adirondacks, is it somewhere worth checking out?  Also, was it very difficult riding with a pack on?  I'm a little nervous about that as I'm completely new to riding.

Its scary but I'm stoked to be doing it :D\n\n", "Yeah I totally gotcha.  I'm gonna be heading along the gulf starting February and head for New Orleans, and once it starts warming up I'm gonna be heading northwest to hit as many national parks as I can.  I was really worried about snow so I'm  trying to plan accordingly.  Whens a good time to head north, would you say?", "Awesome!  It seems like this has a more international feel to it and I'm going to be riding solely in the US, but I've been planning on doing some travel to Southeast Asia next year, I definitely could use this then.  This is a fantastic idea and you should keep developing it!  ", "Thanks man!  I'll check it out right now.  ", "Been riding for a solid month everyday.  Have about another month and a half before I take off!", "You don't have to hang it if you've got a canister! Also if you're not going to be anywhere where canisters are strictly enforced (Yosemite, I'm looking at you) you should check out the Ursack. It's not as foolproof as the canister but pretty effective when used correctly and much, much lighter / more flexible. Either way, you don't want to have your food right outside your door, but 1000 ft. is really pretty far. ", "Get a rack and some panniers. You can carry a lot of stuff. What kind of bike do you have? The Adirondacks is the biggest state park in the country. It's the entire north section of New York State. Route 28 (29?)and 9N are amazing to ride and there are plenty of places to camp for free if you look hard enough. There's so much beautiful territory in the Adirondacks...I mean I did ride 1300 miles almost exclusively in the park.  ", "No problem at all!", "Feel free to ask some questions, I'll see what I can help you with.", "Hard to say.  So long as you're leaving to head around the gulf in the Feb, you'll probably be chasing warmer temps as you head up the coast.  New England is still cold until April or so, but you'll be fine.   \n\nAdvice from my trip: staying dry and warm is really key to enjoying your ride.  Nothing more miserable than getting wet, cold, and going into a tent wet and cold at the end of they day.  ", "Wow, that's ballsy to go on a long term ride with 2.5 months of riding! Which bike did you end up getting? I can only recommend bringing an extra pair of riding gloves to swap out when one pair gets soaked. It'd be interesting to see a list of stuff you're bringing on this ride. Be safe!", "Yeah I'm thinking the Ursack looks like a good option that I'll probably just hang anyhow.  Thanks for pointing that out!", "Haven't bought the bike yet, but I was looking at something like a KTM 650cc or something similar that can possibly be taken off road if needed.  I really don't know much about bikes so I'm trying to learn as much as I can before I purchase.  And I definitely am going to add that to my list of places to go now :D\n", "Yeah I'm definitely going to be bringing a big tarp for overhead so I can dry things off, but I know I'm not always going to have the luxury of trees nearby.  I'm a nooby biker so I'm trying to avoid rain as much as I can.  ", "As comfortable as I'm feeling riding right now, I definitely am intimidated by the trip.  I'm gonna be putting up a full gear list within the month (REI used gear sale coming up on the 4th, hehe).  I ended up getting a Kawasaki Versys 650 with a trunk case and saddlebags.  The thing packs a punch!", "Want my advice? Get a drz400. A 650 waaay too big for a beginner in terms of both weight and power. If you drop a 650 you likely won't be able to get it back up by yourself without pulling your back.  I did my trip on a 200cc and was doing 55 mph for almost all of it with 100 lbs of gear. ", "I'm gonna be traveling for about six or seven months of pure travel.  Sure there'll be some places where I'll stay for a week or two at a time, but will it be okay for that many miles?\n", "The drz is really reliable and cheap to fix if that's what you're asking. You can pick up a used one for a few thousand bucks for sure. You'll also get better mpgs with a smaller motor. I averaged about 55-60 mpgs on my 200. ", "Yeah basically what I meant.  I've just heard from people that you'll want a more powerful bike for going longer distances, didn't know any truth to that matter.  And yeah gas mileage is super important to me.  ", "Engine size ain't shit. What they meant was the bigger the bike the more comfortable the ride will (probably) be.

I think the system is bullshit and completely broken.  \nPlan is: Finish the course, get a programming job abroad (which pays very well) and start living the life I want.  \n\n\nHowever, I'm considering the military.  \nNot for the money or benefits. Programming pays 5 times more.  \nI'm considering it for the adventure. This would mean infantry, and maybe trying out for special forces (NOT SAYING I WOULD MAKE IT).  \n\n\nI always loved physical activity and thrill seeking.  \nPlayed lots of sports growing up, especially federate basketball for 9 years. I also swam for 4 years.  \nI'm currently boxing, about to start BJJ, and going skydiving soon.  \n\nMilitary Pros:\n\n* I'm sick of offices and classrooms, and the monotony of the bland 9 to 5.  \n* I'm looking for challenge, adventure, camaraderie, travel, brotherhood, etc.  \n* I also want recognition and glory (I'm fully aware this might not be a healthy reason to join).  \n* I'm pretty disciplined. I keep an organized room, wardrobe, house, etc and exercise regularly (except school, I was never disciplined in school).  \n\nMilitary Cons:  \n\n* I am not nationalistic. I don't identify with my country, and I don't feel the need to serve it. I like the US and Switzerland better, but don't feel a duty to serve them either.  \n* I question what I would be fighting for. Would it be a legitimate cause? Or would I just be fighting to benefit bankers, tyrants and war dogs?  \n* I'm against the war on drugs, and highly interventionist foreign policy. Only hostage rescue seems justifiable, where there is no agenda. But do hostage rescue units only rescue hostages? Or do they also go on pointless killings and nonsensical drug busts?  \n* I don't have a college degree, so I can't join as an officer. Probably would get a lot more shit (especially since I'm a bit older, at 22.)  \n* I don't like to blindly following orders and not think of why I'm doing something.  \n* I like controlling my options. Signing a 2 to 6 year contract kinda scares me. I get bored very easily.  \n* Should I go kill people just because I'm bored, depressed and looking for adventure?  \n  \n\nI could join the Portuguese military, which might suck.  \nI could get a Programming job in the USA, get citizenship, and join in a few yrs.  \nMight be the adventure of a lifetime.  \n\nBut might suck too, and when I get out, I won't have nearly as much money, wealth or independence. And I want to start a family down the line.  \n\nOr maybe I just need to go on a few adventure competitions, travel and have fun once I finally get some independence.  \n\nAny advice?

It's too dangerous, and it has no transition into the civilian world.\n\nInstead, consider Intelligence or Linguistics. You'll still travel, but won't be kicking in doors and getting shot at.

Ask yourself these questions:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\-Is your body conditioned for traveling the distance of a marathon for over 700 days straight?\n\n\\-Do you have a plan for how you'll be able to consistently consume 4000+ calories every day, including the \\~400g carbohydrates and \\~200g protein you'll be needing? What about access to 2+ gallons of water per day? What about micronutrients and electrolytes?\n\n\\-Are you prepared to get caught off-guard by poor weather? Do you have a plan for avoiding hypothermia in these situations?\n\n\\-Do you have a solid amount of experience with land nav? I've been doing backcountry backpacking for my entire adult life and I once got lost for hours in an area probably no larger than an acre\n\n\\-Are you prepared to store absolutely zero food or scented items at night? If not, how will you diffuse situations with bears, wolves, coyotes, etc?\n\n\\-Do you have a medical emergency plan that will cover a broken leg in the middle of nowhere?\n\n\\-Do you have enough money to fully support all of your food, water, shelter, medical bills, clothing, and various expenses if worse comes to worst?\n\n\\-Do you have a consistent route mapped out for your entire journey, or are you just going to wing it? Slight deviations from your course could EASILY add months and months for a trek at this magnitude.\n\n\\-Are you comfortable with the vast majority of your journey happening along the side of state highways or side streets? This will probably be necessary to avoid private land, impassable stretches, etc. This one's important to note because, outside of passing through historic downtowns and national parks, you'd mostly be kicking beer cans on the side of a highway for 2-3 years.\n\n\\-Are you prepared to survive encounters with criminals and people who would do you harm?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not trying to belittle you or your plan, but these are all very realistic needs you'd have and from your post, I doubt you've really thought this through or have the vast experience needed for this.

A few examples:\n\nWalking/running shoes would be significantly lighter weight and much more comfortable than boots for a journey like this. \n\nWhy carry a flint fire starter when a small bic lighter is light weight, easier to use, and 100x more reliable.\n\nYou dont need to carry a wok with you, you aren't going to be doing any gourmet cooking. You diet will turn into instant mashed potatoes and ramen before long, all you need is a small burner and a 600ml pot to boil water in. \n\nI don't really get what the rope is for? You don't have the luxury to carry things  \"you might need\"\n\nOn top of that you seem to be missing several essential components on a journey like this. You don't have a shelter system, a sleeping bag, or a sleeping pad. without these you won't be able to sleep warm at night and we'll just be generally miserable, cold, and wet. \n\nThere are a few subreddits you should read through:\n\nr/ultralight will teach you what gear you need for a trip like this \n\nR/ulgeartrade to buy used gear", "All of this is true! I do have a rough road plan that I'm going to keep refining until I leave. You make an excellent point about the budgeting; I'm going to be leaving with at least $2,000 as an emergency fund for food, medical visits, etc. My general plan is to walk about 25 miles a day, which would make the entire journey about 2-3 years long.

Thankfully I still have insurance as well, so a broken wrist won't cost me the adventure, even though it would mean going under the radar for a while.

Posts that break this rule will be removed (after being given a reminder to post the comment first).\n\nThis hopefully would have two goals, firstly to reduce the amount of \"fire and forget\" posts that are only here to generate traffic for a different web site, and secondly to provide some extra background information that could start discussion.\n\n2) Scheduled posts - weekly or monthly posts that serve a specific purpose within the /r/Adventures community.\n\nThis will give you somewhere to discuss and organise meetups, events, or ask questions that will draw upon the expertise within the community.\n\n3) New mod - off the back of one of the comments I posted in the 'awful' thread, I had someone contact me wanting to help build the community, who has since been added as a mod.

I mean, I liked going outside and I had camped lots (with boy scouts) before I started wanting to \"adventure\" but I guess I started to think about what I was doing more consciously. I made sure I had water and a knife, and maybe some matches/lighter on short hikes/walks to be prepared, just in case, you know. :) I bought some snowshoes (because winter) and some decent hiking boots and gaiters and starting snowshoeing as much as I had time for (never enough) with school. I happened to have some gear already (water bottle, knives, axe, backpack, camp shovel) and I bought anything small/inexpensive that I thought I needed. Having an REI/MEC membership makes you feel like an adventurer. I think if you want to adventure and you start doing it, whatever \"it\" is will become apparent.

Start small with half-day trips and work your way up as you get experience *planning* small adventures. Once you can successfully have small adventures of the type you want you can start planning similar trips or go on longer adventures. Going on an adventure with someone else can make things safer in some respects, but can also complicate things so take that into consideration.\n\nConsider how long your adventure will last. Determining factors are: financial cost; physical and mental cost (stress); time spent away from work, life insurance policies, time spent away from family, friends, and other responsibilities.\n\nFor example, if you want to go hiking: Start with a half-day hike and plan out every major aspect of your half-day. Determine how you're going to get there, what supplies you'll need (how much water you'll carry and what you'll carry it in), where you'll park or how you'll get transport back, and how long you'll be out. Also plan out objectives, like things you want to see along the way. Once you're comfortable with that you can prepare for hikes in other areas (maybe more rugged terrain) or longer hikes in the area you're now familiar with. Build up a comfort level and then push those boundaries a little each time.\n\nCamping as even more stuff associated with it since you'll be staying overnight and will require more supplies as well as experience dealing with camping-related problems (like what do you do if it starts raining and your tent leaks?).\n\nAs BerryMagic mentioned getting some ideas from other people about things you'd like to do is a good place to start. You can also check out sites like [Discover Adventure](http://www.discoveradventure.com/) for different types of activities that you can work up to in the future. But a lot of good adventures can probably be had locally, just check out state and national parks and monuments that are local to you.", "It's different for everyone.

To have an adventure you need to engage the place with an activity. WHat your activity is depends upon you. Even photography or cooking with ingredients collected in a strange location can be an adventure.\n3) Evolution - You should learn more about yourself, your skills and your world through the whole experience.\n\nIf whatever you do while \"adventuring\" broadly fits into these lines, then in my insignificant opinion, you're having an adventure!\n", "Google Earth is your new best friend.

Adventure means whatever is out of your comfort zone. If you are nervous being in the woods get on a trail, if you are comfortable on a trail, get off it. If you are comfortable in the daylight, hike through the night. If you are terrified of tight places, try finding a cave. Heights not your thing? start rock climbing.

Try new things. Get fit (needed for adventures). Grow your skills.  \n\n\nGood luck! Message me in a year :)", "Ah! I've been trying to figure this out for a decade - I am so glad you and others are asking these same question. I have a couple ideas, and a dream.\n\nFirst, there are some fantastical travel experiences that dont feel so removed from a wild video game world. Exploring the fantasy town Sintra (Portugal) entirely on foot, island hopping by kayak or sailboat at Apostle Islands (WI) / Acadia (ME) / Voyageurs (MN) / the Manitou Islands (MI) / Egmont Key (FL), hiking or rafting into remote Stehekin (WA, United States), staying in a fire watch tower (United States), hiking the esoteric 50+ site temple trail along Lake Biwa (Japan), visiting Evermore (UT) or Meow Wolf in Santa Fe (NM, United States), visiting urban ruins like Hill 88 over SF (CA, United States), spending a week at the Witcher School in Poland, literally any of the thousands of castle ruins in Spain/Germany/Italy/France/UK, cave hiking at places like Pinnacles National Park/Lava Beds/Oregon Cave/Kartchner Caverns, spending an evening at a tavern like River Inn (CA, United States), or hiking the Cinque Terre (Italy) cliff towns.\n\nObviously Ren Faires are great for a weekend getaway, but there are so many theme based experiences for people who know where to look. Zombie apocalypse paintball, metalworking classes, orienteering and Geocacheing, historical villages with colonial/western/medieval/steampunk themes, story and themed 5k runs and escape rooms, watchmaking classes... I mean anything you like, other people probably like too. I've been sporadically taking broadsword fighting classes in CA and MI for almost a year now, they have videos online that are fine if you've done some intro classes already.\n\nOn the subject of theme based experiences, I've always dreamed of building fantasy-scape, some hybrid of a National Park and WestWorld's themed world, with open exploration (but without characters and murder and stuff). Get a property the size of two 18 hole golf courses, build a tower in an old rock quarry, put a shrine deep in the woods, maybe some altars in the middle of a river or some statues underwater, have a bunch of mossy totem pillars scattered everywhere, and a small tavern where people can come for a drink or a cheap bed if they drink too much. People come and wander and explore to their hearts content, finding all the little wishing wells and fairy villages and trees with doors in them. Maybe an occasional solstice or Belltyne festival. Literally studying Landscape Architecture mostly just for this, probably will end up being a pet project on my own private property, but damn I dream about it constantly.", "If you actually want real risk and to be a real adventurer, start training hard. You will find adventure, the sense of death staring you in the face, and unspeakably beautiful vistas in the mountains. \n\nYou dismiss \u201chiking and stuff\u201d, but I get the sense that you\u2019ve spent minimal actual time outdoors. Travel to the himalaya in Pakistan where there is a nonzero chance of someone with an assault rifle wandering in to base camp. Or spend a night solo in the woods and see how much you jump at every time a leaf hits the ground. Rock and Ice climb where you are only as safe as the protection you\u2019ve placed. Quit your comfortable job and go travel with a backpack to some unstable and beautiful part of the world that will push your boundaries. \n\nOr become a professional wrestler I guess.", "I relate to this post on a deep level", "Try whitewater rafting. A ton of fun, good exercise, and a bit of danger involved.\n\nRock climbing is also an option. Start indoors to learn. If you don't have anyone to hope the ropes for you, bouldering is a good single person activity. Once you get better you can progress outside.\n\nAlso keep in mind not to make anything more risky than it has to be, part of what makes a potentially dangerous activity fun is knowing you're going in prepared.", "If its skyrim your trying to replicate you can legit find lots of beneficial herbs and make all sorts of tinctures.

All of which I hope to participate in one day. For example the Morocco Monkey Run, where you take a mini-motorbike and ride through the desert with two big parties at the start and finish. All the while you repair and maintain your own bike. There's also the Mongol Rally hosted by the same people but involving crappy cars and a race through Mongolia stopping at nomad camps and maintaining your own car. I would also suggest getting into hunting and fishing, as both of those combined with a bit of camping can really replicate the feeling of monster hunter or skyrim. If you do take up hunting I'd definitely suggest using a bow and carving up your own animals and eating them and using every bit of it. In my opinion that's the best way to hunt as well as the most thrilling. I hope you find some great adventures!!", "Look for challenging hikes.

When we get back, I get straight in to bed shivering, trying to rest off this whole illness ahead of the big day tomorrow, our main plan. I ask ma to wake me up at sunset has we have amazing views from our balcony. I get up to see an amazing sunset, somewhat a silver lining to what was a bad day, then go back to sleep.   \n\n\nWhen I wake up the aches have gone but other cold symptoms are still there. We head into town to get a meal which is an hour long walk round trip eat and then head home. I still have a problem, my legs are still super heavy. I know that for tomorrow, for this to work this has to change. Sadly, we get in and call it a night.  \n\n\nThe big day, I get up and my legs feel normal, all the aches and pains have subsided but other cold symptoms are still present. We get ready and leave the apartment to get a taxi which is the equivalent of \u00a350 and the nearest taxi service is 6 miles away. When we're on our way to a point we can call a taxi when we see our airbnb host. He asks if we are on our way to Preikestolen as we mentioned it previously. Give me 10 minutes he says and I'll drive you. He takes us to the hike start point and says call me when you are back down and I will come and get you.  \n\n\nI begin the hike and as soon as I start the views begin to emerge, beautiful. On the way up, I see people on their way down, roughly every half an hour. There is a point where I feel I'm close so the next set people I see I ask them if I'm close? They say no! ! I carry on. I must be three quarters of the way up when I stumble across a frozen lake this place is full of surprises. When I reach the top there is a  couple just starting to make their way down. When they leave it's just me standing at the edge of a cliff. I'm in awe, I take a seat and just take in the stunning views. It then begins to rain so I make my way down the cliff, a two hour climb back down and get ready for the plane home", "Nice video and it also sounds like you had quite a adventure.

As it happens, we gave that novice monk a lift down the mountain. He wasn't very pleasant, and didn't even say thanks at the end. LOL. \n[img]http://i.imgur.com/yeaNwsA.jpg[/img]\n\nThe road back down was a lot more fun than the road up.

The developers had plans to refurbish the Bokor Palace, but the work stalled due to lack of interest in the whole project. \nSo what you saw was the first part of the unfinished refurbishment, that only dates back a few years. All the foliage (green moss, orange lichen and small ferns etc.) was removed and every surface was stripped back and rendered. \n\nThe part of the hotel facing the coast had all the windows bricked up on the ground floor, with holes built in to shoot through. There was the remains of an anti-aircraft gun on the hill above the church, and it was funny to see how the paths and steps up were carefully paved with tiles from the hotel floor. \n\nHere's another post I made about the nearby post office that was in ruins and has since been demolished:\n\nhttp://phnompenhplaces.blogspot.com/2010/12/bokor-post-office.html"]}, {"title": "Sequoia National Park is really impressive.", "body": "", "id": "4e1j8d", "image": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arwVE6QluHQ", "num_comments": 4, "link": "/r/adventures/comments/4e1j8d/sequoia_national_park_is_really_impressive/", "upvotes": 11, "comments": ["you're double dipping the Karma Chris B.", "Great video", "I do not think I can do that.

It's a centuries-old pilgrimage route going from the south of France to the western coast of Spain. It used to be a very popular catholic pilgrimage route, but now it's spread beyond it's religious roots and many people of many different backgrounds walk it every year.\n\nIt's a popular choice for people who are at a crossroads in life, or want to prove to themselves they are capable of undertaking something massive. When you said you wanted an adventure that would give you a new outlook on life, this would be it! The Camino changes you, often in ways you didn't expect.\n\nThe experience forces you to live differently, to rethink your priorities, and to challenge yourself every day. Technically it's hiking, but you don't have to be one of those go-getting, super-active, wake-up-at-6-for-my-morning-5k-and-quinoa-smoothie kinds guy. I'm a whiny, lazy, sedentary slob that would rather go on Reddit than go outdoors, and rather order take-out than cook for myself. But somehow, getting up every day for a month and knowing I'd have to walk 20k to get to wherever I'd be sleeping that night, carry all my belongings with me, rely on those I met along the way to help me, but knowing that at the end of the day I'd be tired but happy, and a bit closer to my objective, was an eye-opening and freeing experience, and I was so surprised and proud to see I could do it, and was capable of more than I thought. It's not something we get to experience often in our daily, urban, north-american lives, and it really takes you out of your comfort zone, but into something really special. Walking the Camino brings you right back to the most basic stuff in life, and forces you to re-evaluate what's really important in your life.\n\nYou meet people along the way, and everybody has a story, a reason for undertaking the journey. Some are celebrating being finally cancer-free, some are getting over a break-up, some are looking for spirituality, some are soul-searching before a big career move, and some just want to prove to themselves that they can do it. They are from all ages, all walks of life, and all parts of the world. You can have alone-time if you wish, or you can meet up with fellow walkers along the way. There really is a community that builds around the trail, and you never need to be alone if you don't want to.\n\nNot only is the actual walk an adventure, but the whole process of getting yourself ready to go is also. I knew I wasn't so fit before going, so knowing I'd have to walk every day for a month, I started walking more in my daily life, and knowing I had an objective (walking the Camino) helped me get fit.\n\nThe trail itself about 35 days of walking from the traditional starting point of Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port, but there are many paths that converge to the \"finish line\" of Santiago de Compostela. You can start anywhere, depending on how much time you have, or skip some bits that are less interesting. It's definitely doable in a month.\n\nIt's less \"extreme\" than the Appalachian trail, because you walk from village to village, and there are many places to sleep and eat along the way. You don't feel lost in the wilderness, basically, since there is always a village nearby, and you get to sleep in little Camino-hostels called \"Albergues\", instead of setting up camp outdoors. \n\nMoney-wise, it's a very cheap trip, providing you can get a cheap plane ticket to start you off. Once you're on the trail, you should be able to live on 20$CAD a day, without too much difficulty. The albergues cost between 0 and 12 Euros, most of them offer free breakfast (sometimes supper). You can make your own meals for 2-4 euros if you share with other travellers. You don't have many other costs than lodging and food. There is a big spirit of helping others, and you'll meet some people who do the trail with no money at all, relying on the free hostels, leftovers, and help from others.\n\nPersonally it's been one of the most memorable adventures of my life, and I'd highly recommend it if it sounds like the sort of adventure you need to do, too!", "Hi, \n\nI'm sorry I cannot suggest adventures in/around Canada, I'm sure others are better suited for that.\n\nBut instead of a single big adventure that ends after a couple of weeks, why not become a member of some adventure sports club?

However don't you think it is factually wrong to speak about water usage per year and not make a distinction between natural and mechanical delivery? \n\nFor example, your initial source listed cotton as using 2,500L of water in a year to produce one t-shirt. Additional sources lists one half of the worlds supply requires mechanical delivery of water. Of that half, mechanical water delivery accounted for less than half of overall usage. So the vast majority comes from natural rainfall, not much we can do about that. These numbers would make that average t-shirt requiring approximately 550L of water, a far cry from the number reported in the initial article.  \n\nAdditionally, digging deeper to the root of the issue, one of the sources of your listed article notes that the most extreme areas require up to 30,000L of water, and nearly 90 percent from irrigated sources. With these areas very localized, this throws the average of the mechanical water usage way out of whack for the market as a whole. \n\nSo, instead of citing numbers that are designed to evoke an emotional response with, at best, dubious sounding numbers, lets talk facts. Lets bring this conversation onto the stage where we can compare apples to apples and cotton to cotton. The real issue here are the areas where extreme irrigation must be used to make the crop viable as a source of income. Lets discuss the locations that are truly doing irreparable harm to the environment and do not buy products from there. Make a movement in these areas to be more environmentally conscious and you'll see greater gains made as a whole. Then you wont be vilifying every person that owns a pair of jeans. It didn't work for people buying Nikes and Apple products. \n\nTL/DR  Always do the math.

(I mean, it's always gonna be far away from anywhere, and turns out you can get there pretty quickly/cheaply with Icelandair.) Parents are thinking of joining for a one week Anchorage to Vancouver typical cruise-type thing, so that's set, but my idea was to fly into Anchorage for 2-3 weeks, rent a car that is allowed on gravel roads, and head off to explore.  I'd be going solo and am pretty much open to anything, and have done my fair share of adventures in the past- loved whitewater kayaking and rafting, am obsessed with geocaching, and like hiking but more daytrips, less multiple days backpacking.\n\nSo I guess the question is, of all the things to do in that part of the world, what are some adventures you did that were really incredible and you'd recommend to others?  This would be in late July/ early August.  Right now I haven't figured much more than do a Denali/ Denali Highway/ Dawson City (not sure if this is feasible, but I really am curious about the Yukon)/ Wrangell-Saint Elias loop, maybe Kenai Peninsula- seems a fairly typical thing to do, but just so many places to stop, so I'm hoping to hear about folks' favorite adventures they've done.  Further, one thing in particular I'd love to do would be to join either a rafting or kayaking trip that takes a few days- maybe 3-4, but no more than a week- but like anything in Alaska it seems like there are a *lot* of choices.\n\nThanks in advance for any tips and suggestions!", "id": "1yskfa", "image": "https://www.reddit.com/r/adventures/comments/1yskfa/help_planning_alaska_trip/", "num_comments": 8, "link": "/r/adventures/comments/1yskfa/help_planning_alaska_trip/", "upvotes": 11, "comments": ["I spent a month in Alaska, and I can offer you some highlights.  It was the best trip of my life, and I'm happy with everything I did there.  \n\nFirst, I should mention that part of the reason I went there was to fish.  I'm going to assume that's not your bag, so I won't bother with those details...but, if you're really into fishing, I can tell you all about that as well.\n\nI flew into Anchorage, spent the night there at the hostel, then took the train to Seward.  If I were you, or anyone else for that matter, I would hold off on renting a car.  I say that for the simple reason that if you rent a car, [you won't take the train!](http://alaskarailroad.com/)  And you have to take the train.  The train runs from [Seward to Fairbanks](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Seward,+AK/Fairbanks,+AK/@62.577127,-153.3905261,6z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x56c79b6ef22affc5:0x5be160c236d211bf!2m2!1d-149.4422222!2d60.1041667!1m5!1m1!1s0x5132454f67fd65a9:0xb3d805e009fef73a!2m2!1d-147.7163889!2d64.8377778!3e0), and it is absolutely unforgettable.  \n\nSo...I hung out in Seward a couple of days.  Amazing little town in the most beautiful setting.  Go to the [SeaLife Center](http://www.alaskasealife.org/) and check out [Exit Glacier in Kenai Fjords National Park!](http://www.nps.gov/kefj/planyourvisit/exit-glacier.htm)\n\nFrom Seward, I took off to Cooper Landing to do some fishing, so we'll skip that.  Then I headed back to Anchorage.  While in Anchorage, you can do just about anything you want, but I highly recommend checking out the [art museum there](http://www.anchoragemuseum.org/art/art.aspx).\n\nFrom Anchorage I took the train north to Talkeetna.  It's a fun place to stop.  Not a ton to do there, but a really neat little town.  Take a few days from there to enjoy Denali National Park.  That's a must.  From there, I went to Fairbanks.  [I stayed here](http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g60826-d1198831-Reviews-GoNorth_Alaska_Hostel-Fairbanks_Alaska.html), and you should too.  From Fairbanks, I took a[ bus up the Dalton Hwy](http://www.wikihow.com/Travel-the-Dalton-Highway) to the Arctic Circle area.  This was cool, and I recommend it as well.\n\nThen I went back to Anchorage, hopped on a plane and headed to Juneau.  Juneau is amazing.  Beautiful place, lots to do, cool vibe.  Stay in the hostel there.  It's nice.  [Definitely hit up Mendenhall Galcier too.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendenhall_Glacier)  Right on the edge of town, and super cool.  I also recommend a tour of the [Alaska Brewing Company](http://www.alaskanbeer.com/).  And if you have the time and money, [go whale watching/](http://www.juneauwhalewatch.com/)You will never ever forget that.\n\nOkay, for a little adventure, I then took the Marine Hwy ferry to Skagway, spent a night there, and then [hiked the Chilkoot Trail.](http://www.nps.gov/klgo/planyourvisit/chilkoottrail.htm)  That took three days, and it was tough...and awesome.  Do it.  From the end of the trail in Bennet, BC, you can then [take another great train](http://www.wpyr.com/) back to Skagway.  From there, you can head back to Juneau, or even better, go down to [Glacier Bay National Park](http://www.nps.gov/glba/index.htm) and continue to explore the southeaster portion of the state, which is usually the destination for the cruises.  I just went back to Juneau, caught a flight back to Anchorage, and headed home.\n\nIn Anchorage, there are tons of places to eat.  I recommend [Humpy's.](http://humpys.com/anc/)  In Seward, [the Railway Cantina](http://railwaycantina.com/) has the best Halibut burrito on the planet.  Talkeetna has [the Roadhouse](http://www.talkeetnaroadhouse.com/cafe-and-bakery.html), which can't be missed.  I can't recall where I ate in Juneau or Fairbanks.\n\nOh, and the food on the train was amazing.  Get the reindeer sausage for sure.\n\nI did all of this alone, at 23 years old, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend any of it to another person.  That being said, like any place, you have to be careful who you trust, and don't get in a car with anyone sketchy.  Assume most people are sketchy.\n\nAlaska is the greatest place on Earth.  Have fun!", "I went to Alaska last year  in august for 2 and a half weeks. Amazing. We rented a car in Anchorage, and drove everywhere, To Homer, to Seward, and up to Denali. My friend made a pretty detailed itinerary we followed , and it was rad. If you want the Itinerary P.M. me and I can get it to you.       \nWith that said, my favorite day hike ( which we did al ot of) was the Harding Ice fields.", "I've been to Alaska twice, once to Denali, once to the Gates of the Arctic. One option would be to rent a packraft, which is a sturdy inflatable raft that is light enough to carry. This allows for some flexible routes that mix hiking and rafting.\n\nHere's a blog I wrote about the Gates trip in which I used a packraft:\n\nhttp://nerdventurer.blogspot.com/", "I solo kayaked for a week along the south-east coast from Ketchikan to Wrangell which was absolutely wild.  I spent some time backpacking around Juneau as well which was absolutely gorgeous.  Here is a [pseudo documentary](https://vimeo.com/70306226) if you're interested.", "Wow.  You are *awesome*, thanks so much!\n\nPut it this way, I'm not anti-fishing, just never done it and don't know anyone who does so haven't been able to get into it.  Actually wait, I went once off the coast of Namibia, where I averaged about 5 minutes per fish, so I'm probably spoiled for life now. ;-)\n\nSeriously though, thanks again!", "I'm interested in traveling Alaska over the summer.

(I\u2019m a US college student and speak basically zero Swahili or Mandarin). \n\nThose are the kinds of experiences you can have through study abroad programs in college; they\u2019re adventures whether you\u2019re in a city or rural area because you get immersed and need to figure things out for yourself. \n\nThese programs would pair you with people and would help get your bearings about safety, though you always need to know your comfort zone and do your own research. I\u2019m a guy, but I know women who have traveled all over Cambodia, Vietnam and Australia alone couch surfing, and women who wouldn\u2019t walk alone to a local store here in a very safe part of Beijing\u2014each situation and person is unique.

Fly home later that night after treating yourself to a fancy dinner. \n\nEarlier this month I was in Norway for work and I had two days of free time, so I did exactly this. I flew to Tromso and spent the night on a northern lights chasing trip and got to cross it off my bucket list. I think I spent maybe $400-450 total. I know that's a lot for some people, but it was within my budget. I didn't have a hotel, so that saved some money.

That\u2019s because, in recent years, I\u2019ve made an adventure out of visiting nature. I\u2019m a city guy with average outdoor experience, so don\u2019t think you have to be a mountaineer to find the edge of a map. Here are some tips to help you find what you seek. \n\nFirst, allow yourself to dream. Dreaming is an essential part of adventure because it lets you think outside the bounds of your everyday. Imagine where you\u2019d like to go, and as you visualize, feel what excites you and makes your heart race. You might recognize this place because a part of you deems it impossible to visit. You have to learn to listen to yourself in order to discover what will fulfill you in particular. Dreams become plans, help focus the mind, and foster anticipation. \n\nSecond, put yourself outside your comfort zone. I noticed you made an excuse when someone suggested hiking or camping. That will certainly prevent you from having an adventure. When you are in a situation that you aren\u2019t 100% certain about, you will be more in the present moment. Not only that, you\u2019ll be surprised how much you learn when you have to. Necessity is the mother of invention, after all. Outside your comfort zone is where things start to get interesting, so go there.\n\nThird, make a plan. Get a paper map and circle waypoints, plot out your route, and gather gear. Some brief research about the area you\u2019ll visit, from the wildlife, to history, to local laws, can help you feel more invested and prepared. A plan will add structure to an otherwise ambiguous task: venturing out into the unknown. Without it, you may feel spiritually lost, if not physically, too. With it, you\u2019ll have things to look forward to and the confidence to overcome disappointing situations. Once you\u2019re in the field, treat this plan as a guide, and defer to your feelings about places, staying as long as you need, or moving on when you\u2019re ready. \n\nTake these tips to heart and you\u2019ll wonder, in the midst of a sweaty, dirty, glorious, gleeful adventure, how you ever lived otherwise. \n\nSee you out there.

It\u2019s okay to wake up in the morning still not knowing where you\u2019re going to travel to or even sleep that night. Being in situations like this where you have nothing to do and everything at your fingertips just opens so many doors for opportunity and adventure!

No skiing. Our train had been delayed for about two hours, so we didn't arrive in time to be able to ski. \nAdventure time! After doing some site-seeing we did what every Dutch person would do; grocery shopping. The town was lively enough, but I didn't exactly feel 'in place'. As a broke college student being surrounded by 4 and 5 star hotels and restaurants wasn't really what you'd call: 'reassuring'. S\u00f6lden does look amazing at first glance, it has a strip club, so who knows what the week will bring.\n\nTag zwei.\n\nFinally. After getting up early we got what we came for. We had split up into two groups. Myself and three others (the newbs) went for a blue slope, and the other two went for a red one. Disclaimer; they've got way more experience. The first route I took wasn't bad, only fell twice. I was sloppy at first but i managed, eventually. But then I made the mistake of going out of my league. Let's just say that I needed a chiropractor by the end of the day; my poor buttocks. \n\nTag drei.\n\nWent out on my own accord today. Felt like working a bit more on my technique. Managed only to fall once when the day was done. Until the last slope on the way back. Damn you, Pavlov! Took a couple of breaks between slopes as well; the view is really amazing, reminds me of Norway. So now my phone is pretty a storage for pictures of mountains. For lunch I had stopped half way through at a restaurant. I had ordered Schnitzel, Bratwurst and Apfelstrudel. Sweet baby zombie Jesus that was delicious. \n\nTag vier.\n\nTook skiing lessons today. Couldn't really improve much on my own so i figured i'd give it a go. A 'friend' of mine wanted to join up. She and I however aren't exactly on the bestest of terms, but there is a status-quo, so I don't care. The group I was assigned to was actually a fun bunch of people. I had to quit after an hour or so. In the morning before skiing I had found out that my ski shoes had gone to shit, so I needed to get rental boots. And the problem with those boots was that my feet eventually felt too much pressure on the front that the blood flow was cut off. So, they would fall asleep after 30 to 60 minutes or so. I actually tried to ski like that, but it only made things worse. Fast forward to the evening, diner time. Made pancakes with a friend. Bacon pancakes. So naturally of course we'd sing makin-bakin-bacon-pancakes whilst doing so.\nEnded the day with a cigar and a beer at a rockbar before going to sleep. \n\nTag f\u00fcnf.\n\nGot up early, needed to get better boots and I had to be at Innerwald at 10:00 AM sharp for lessons. About the boots again, long story short my feet ached the entire day. They gave me special shoe soles for my weird feet, but it didn't help. So I buckled up and I was in immense pain for the entirety of the day. Nothing i couldn't take. I did learn a lot and I didn't fall due to lack of technique, so that's a victory. Went back to the shoe store to tell them the shoe soles didn't help, they then said i needed even more expensive ones. The price went from 40 to 80 to 120 euro's!\n\"Imma sleep on it, bye-bye.\" And they say that Germans are assertive. The looks on their faces; priceless. \n\nTag sechs.\n\nNobody had lessons anymore to attend, so we went with the entire group. Covered a lot of ground actually. It went extremely well. I'd say one of the better days of the week. My feet still ached, but with a couple of breaks now and then everything was fine.\nOn to the main event; sledding. We had heard about a place were you could sled a very, very long way down and my god, this was one of the most fun things I had ever done. In the beginning no one had any control over the sled what so ever; which was hilarious. Afters 10 minutes of crashing into heaps of snow, and each other mostly, mostly me (damn you Sjoerd), we had finally mastered the sled. And let me tell you, those things go insanely fast. \n\nTag sieben. \n\nGroup day, social activity!\nWe all left on the same time, so we had decided to stick together for most of the day. We had covered most of the mountain range, god my feet ached like hell again. Worth it though. Hanging out with everybody else was fun. I'm a kind of guy that tends to stick to himself, a loner if you will, but i can genuinely say that this holiday has been a blast. \n\nTag acht.\n\nThe last day on the slopes already. Couldn't believe the week had gone by this fast. Decided to ski alone. Wanted to do a couple of slopes by myself without making pit-stops. Wanted to end on a high note however; a red slope. As it turned out, a scene from the new James bond movie (Spectre) was actually shot here. So, I went for the James Bond route. Upon getting to the summit of the mountain I realized I had made a mistake. It was snowy and windy as hell. But I was bound and determined to do it. And I did. First couple of minutes were let's just say, 'interesting', but eventually I made it back to solid ground. So, yeah, up yours 007! The last thing i had wanted to do that day wasn't skiing, no, I had planned to make a snowman. And by Jove that was a magnificent snowman. Spent two hours building it. Afterwards I went to diner with my friends. We had ordered the biggest pizza known to man. Then we waited for our cab, it was time to go back home. Emphasis on waited actually. Our cab was delayed.Then we had to wait for our bus to the train station. If one of my friends hadn't made a sprint to the busstop there was a good chance we would've missed it. So cheers for Wesley's limping. Everything that could've gone wrong for the journey back home did. But we made it to the train station in time and we had escaped S\u00f6lden. I'm joking about 'escaping S\u00f6lden'. My time in S\u00f6lden was great. You might be wondering: \"How come your cab was delayed?\" It was parked at the wrong house. About 30 meters from where we were standing. Yeah, i hate google maps too. \n\nThanks for reading, hope you enjoyed it!\n\n", "id": "49nevf", "image": "https://www.reddit.com/r/adventures/comments/49nevf/my_skitrip_in_s\u00f6lden_austria/", "num_comments": 4, "link": "/r/adventures/comments/49nevf/my_skitrip_in_s\u00f6lden_austria/", "upvotes": 9, "comments": ["Ah man.

Just got back from a solo backpacking trip across Southeast Asia a few weeks ago and spent about a month and a half in Thailand. \n\nIf you're into rock climbing, basejumping, or just general outdoors activities, you really can't beat Ton Sai. Beautiful limestone cliffs, dense jungles, and a great beach-- though Railay, just a hike through the jungle or a climb over some slippery rocks, has better swimming. There's also great sea kayaking! Most accommodation on the island comes in the form a bamboo bungalow, which are cheap (I paid about $15 a night in high season) and pretty cool as well. I loved Ton Sai so much. \n\nAnother great option is Chiang Mai, in northern Thailand. Chiang Mai is kind of the opposite of Ton Sai-- not a beach in sight-- but it's the jumping off point for trekking in the area. Most hostels have TONS of pamphlets offering all kinds of excursions-- ziplining, multiple day treks to neighboring hill tribes, jungle hiking, etc.-- and it's a cool place to hang out in, too. While in Chiang Mai, I spent some time at Elephant Nature Park and had such an amazing time. If you're interested in seeing elephants in Southeast Asia, I would recommend ENP a thousand times. There's so much abuse happening in the area involving elephant tourism, but this organization really treats their animals well.\n\nI also really loved Ko Lipe. There isn't a lot in the way of activities, it's more a lazy beach kind of place, but the water is crystal clear and there's great snorkeling just off of the shore. My favorite Thai island!\n\nUnrelated, but since you're interested in the area, I would suggest looking into Indonesia. Sumatra is absolutely beautiful and wild, Java has amazing volcanoes, and Bali has such a magical, chill vibe. Worth looking into! ", "I was in the area for 3 months. If you are looking to get away from the touristy stuff and enjoy the country side you will definitely want to head north to Chaing Mai and the surrounding area. Prices are cheaper, people are nicer, and the country side is second to none. Try to make it to Pai if you can. It's a little off the beaten path but it is a backpackers paradise filled with waterfalls, mineral springs, jungle expeditions, and beautiful mountains. Take the overnight train for the best travel experience.", "I've been twice and it's a snap.  However I haven't been back since just before the tsunami and have no idea what things are like in Bangkok right now.\n\nBuy the latest Lonely Planet on Thailand and get on their message board.  ", "I lived in Chiang Mai for a bit. Go go go. Few recommendations on some stuff, like which elephant camp are best (Patara) or a waterfall to go see (Mae Fork Waterfall)", "These recommendations are awesome! Thanks everyone.", "Also look into Ko Lanta if you want a more chilled out, couple-oriented island.", "Rock climbing at railay beach in krabi! Climb some big coral walls overlooking the entire bay! Breathtaking! Have fun!", "How would you say you spent during your time in Thailand? That sounds like a blast though, I want to spend a lot of time in Southeast Asia once I finish school.", "Also, what method did you use for getting to Sumatra and Indonesia? How much did that cost?\n", "I have been to Thailand three times and I have greatly enjoyed it there every time. I must agree that Chiang Mai is absolutely fantastic! There is is so much to do there from visiting temples, seeing a Muay Thai (kickboxing) match, enjoying unique and variety cuisine, exploring the surrounding countryside including hill tribes (just be careful not to get into a taxi scam where they take you into the countryside and then demand a ridiculous amount of money in order to bring you back into town or threaten to leave you), and so much more! ", "My budget, excluding airfare, was about 2000 USD. This includes all the flights I took between countries (I used AirAsia, which is a great budget airline if you're flexible with dates-- think $25 from Bali to Singapore) and all of my accommodation. I slept in hostels and guesthouses mostly, but I did splurge a couple of times and get a nice hotel room, so I definitely wasn't slumming it 100% of the time. \n\nI flew from Kuala Lumpur to Surabaya in Java, and just made my way from there. I think there's a ferry that goes from Malacca to Sumatra, and I'm pretty sure there's one from Singapore to Sumatra as well. Once you're in Indonesia, there's tons of options for island to island transport, just be aware that Indonesia is HUGE and you can easily spend DAYS on a bus when it would only be a little bit more expensive to fly a budget airline! I originally planned to bus it from Yogyakarta to Bali (15 hours!), but after finding an hour-long flight for a mere $10 more than a bus ticket, I opted to fly. ", "That's so awesome. What were your favorite moments of the trip? And how were the people? Can someone who can only speak English get by?", "The people were fantastic! Locals were always very genial and interested in what I was doing, especially if I wasn't in a super touristy area. I only speak English and was fine, if you stick to Thailand there's always gonna be someone around that can speak English or translate for you. The only time the language barrier was an issue for me was in Java, and usually a bit of creative pantomiming got my point across. \n\n I had a great time climbing giant sea rocks in Ton Sai, and bathing elephants in Chiang Mai. I loved every moment of my stay in Ko Lipe, even though I did the same thing every day-- wake up, breakfast, swim, nap, explore, dinner, sleep-- it never felt routine and the island itself is so damn beautiful.

I will also be heading out there to film a documentary of the expedition.  \n\nThe Great Australian Triathlon will take around six months to complete. It will span over 8000 km of the continent and will be split up into three distinct sections; a 600km trail run across Tasmania, a 350km kayak paddle across the Bass Strait, and a roughly 7000km cycle across the mainland from the bottom of Victoria to the top of Cape York, Queensland. \n\n As an outdoor enthusiast and documentary film maker I want to explore the reasons people like Ben give up well paid jobs and comfortable lives, battle through injuries and sacrifice their careers for the sake of what some people would see as pointless goals.  Ben will face countless challenges from extreme fatigue to hungry hungry crocodiles, dangerous tides and wild bush fires, all for no material benefit. He\u2019s not being paid (he\u2019s spent all his savings on the trip), he won\u2019t get a world record (Guinness won\u2019t recognise the expedition), and it's likely that large parts of the trip will be a 'sufferfest'.

The city is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world and is not only the spiritual capital of India, but also the holiest of seven sacred cities in Hinduism, and it played a significant role in the development of Buddhism.\n\nBuddha is said to have founded Buddhism in Varanasi around 528 BC when he gave his first sermon at Sarnath, a nearby city located about 10km away. The city continued to grow in its religious significance and was under Muslim rule for three centuries from 1194, until a tolerant emperor restored some religious respite to Varanasi, which still remains a center of activity for Hindus.\n\nFor centuries, education, philosophy, culture, arts and religion have flourished here, and when you visit the religious center of Varanasi, you\u2019ll see that this is what fuels the city and keeps it vibrant."]}, {"title": "Exploring Hidden Mojave Lava Tubes of Pisgah Crater", "body": "", "id": "ago2cs", "image": "https://youtu.be/V7g3fvQKn2c", "num_comments": 6, "link": "/r/adventures/comments/ago2cs/exploring_hidden_mojave_lava_tubes_of_pisgah/", "upvotes": 10, "comments": ["I took off into the Mojave Desert to explore the hidden lava tubes around Pisgah Crater.

I'm from Florida, I go to college in Miami, and I have researched (to a limited extent) how to get into Cuba without having to go through one of those awful-sounding \"look how great the US is\" tours. I'm really interested in going, and cycling through the country, maybe finding out what it's really like as opposed to what's portrayed in the media. How exactly does one coordinate getting in though? I can't imagine someone would just book a flight from Florida to Mexico to Cuba from the US, and I don't know how someone could coordinate something like boat hopping. And what happens coming back? If they do stamp my passport, can I still come back to the US? Will I be looking at jail time?\n\nJust some important questions.

The penalties are very clearly written, and if they ever find out after you post some pics on FB/reddit/whatever, you can get in trouble.  \n\nCuba is Forbidden Fruit for American 20 year olds to be sure.  People don't realize just how much tourism Cuba gets, though.  More than 1 Million Canadians go there every year.  And that's just Canadians.  That's a lot for such a small country of 11 million.  ", "I was a travel agent but I didn't specialize in Cuba so my knowledge isn't perfect but I have the gist of it.\n\nIf you don't get a license (usually given to journalists, people with special work requirements, or people visiting family) you can't go to Cuba FROM the US, so you have to leave from another port. The have the newer [people-to-people](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/10/travel/at-long-last-legal-trips-to-cuba.html?_r=0) trips which are probably the tours you are talking about, but A. They are expensive and B. You have a weird escort the entire time and you have to \"experience the culture\" in a \"controlled environment\" which is probably not the adventure that you want. As a former travel agent, I would have had to recommend one of those, but I think that sounds lame.\n\nYou  have a few problems getting there-\nEntering the country- Can't enter through the US so you have to go through a third party country. Mexico is probably the easiest and least expensive from Miami, but Canada and the Bahamas are also popular options. You have to book your tickets separately, meaning you'll book a one-way ticket to Mexico, a round trip ticket from Mexico to Havana, then a ticket back from Mexico to the US. They won't stamp US passports in Cuba because they know you'll get in trouble for it and they want you to come (I think they put a sticker in your passport, or give you a card, but it is something not permanent). But you will have two entry stamps for Mexico, which is suspicious. You can try to convince Mexican customs NOT to put a second stamp in your passport (I haven't done it, but I've heard that people have so who knows), or you can depart from one place and return from another (eg Fly Miami to Cancun, Cancun to Havana, Havana to Nassau [Bahamas], Nassau to Miami). When you get back to the US they'll ask you to fill out one of those border forms that ask where you've been. You can't say you went to Cuba (crime) but you can't really lie (crime). If they REALLY question you, you can use the 5th amendment, etc etc, but which one is the lesser of several evils? MAKE YOUR DECISIONS. I DON'T KNOW. \n\nMONEY!!- Duh, you can't use US currency. You can technically exchange US currency there, but I think it is an extra 10% fee or something, which is ridiculous. Better to get Euros or pesos before leaving the US and then change it in Cuba. Don't change money at airports. You can use credit and debit cards there, but they can't be from a US bank. So you can get one of those international debit cards, but they can't be affiliated with any US bank or their subsidiaries. You should look into that more specifically, ask your bank (regular tellers won't know but someone there probably will).\n\nThere technically is no US embassy in Cuba. I think they have some people who work out of the Swiss embassy, but you can't just stroll in and tell them you're American and you're having problems without getting in trouble, so only go if it is a serious emergency. Passport stolen, you become a political prisoner, you accidentally start an uprising. You know, actual trouble. I guess some people just like to visit their embassy, which I think it kind of weird. Who knows.\n\nYou have to be careful to go through your bags and take everything that is identifiably Cuban out before returning home. Receipts, any labels, just some garbage that says \"Havana is for lovers\"- all of it. That's bad and will get you in more trouble. \n\nCUBA IS REALLY COOL, THOUGH. Beyonce went there. If Beyonce can do it, you can do it. People do it all the time. Worth the hassle! Have fun! Be safe! ", "I'm researching this as well.\n\nSo far, I've found no one who's claimed to have gotten questioned over the double-entry stamp from Mexico. \n\nThat's the major open question. Is it worth flying in through mexico and out through another country? \n\nOtherwise, it doesn't look too risky. But remember: you're off the grid.

You should work on narrowing down your desires first - before searching for the default 'adventure'.   \n\n1. How old are you? Have you any experience with spending time outdoors in foreign places? \n2. What is your budget? You'll most likely need to buy gear, food, transportation, accommodations, etc. on this adventure. \n3. When do you plan to take this adventure? Tomorrow, next month, next  year? Do you want it to last a day, weekend, month, or longer?   \n4. Does the country matter? Do you want to do this near to home? USA or abroad? \n\nThe more details you can add - the more valuable advice you'll get.   \n\n&#x200B;\n\nStart by finding a niche. \n\n* Like **hiking** for example. Then search for hiking trails in the state/country you want to explore. \n* Or **kayaking** \\- and find waterways that make fun boating adventures. \n* Or **biking** \\- and find a long road to peddle. \n* Or **skiing** \\- and learn to ride steep slopes. \n* Or **mountains** \\- and pick a high peak you want to summit. \n* Or **travel** \\- and look for a new city/area that you've never been. \n\nor any other type of activity that you consider an 'adventure'. This niche will get you out of the generic 'adventure' keyword and into real options. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy advice is to start small. People rarely go on major adventures with little experience. Once you've picked your niche - start with a simple version of what you want your big trip to become. Learn the skills for that niche, buy the gear, make mistakes. Then work your way up to the big time. \n\nAlso - movies are not real. Don't frame your entire adventure/life on what you see in movies (or instagram). Sure - take inspiration from those sources - but remember that they are fake.

The last couple of years I've been worried that I'm giving reddit gold to people who don't login to their accounts very often, so don't get the benefit of it if it expires before they login next. Because of this, if any of the winners haven't made a post or comment that I can see on their profile in the last 7 days, I will drop them a PM and wait for them to reply before I send them the award.\n\nThe following list of top posts in this sub may help you if you are looking for a specific high scoring post, but you do not need to limit yourself to only a post listed here.

You can bring that quest feeling into your real-life adventures, and when you do, it is like nothing else on earth.\n\nIf you care about the justice side of things--fighting evil, righting wrongs--there is always volunteering. Find a charity that does work you care about and give your time. You are gaining new experiences (which is the heart of adventure) and also fighting injustices, just like a goblin slayer.\n\nAlso, if you really want to do some fanciful monster-slaying, there is always tabletop gaming. I know some will laugh at me for this, but these games are adventures in every sense of the word (new experiences, quests, the unexpected, great finds, strong effort, etc.), and they don't come with the limitations of the \"real world.\"\n\nBest of luck in finding your quest!

Working on a startup idea with a team was an awesome experience in itself but it got much crazier. After everything was over, 6 of us rented a car and drove to San Francisco to stay at the StartupBus sister company [StartupHouse](http://startuphouse.com). We stopped at Yosemite for a few hours and rather than following any trails just started climbing up. That led to [this picture](https://scontent-ort2-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/13502018_10153727125538785_1246044569146021158_n.jpg?oh=a64a3e37f707fcc543779115d3d1f343&oe=5A2FCE3A) and after a short time we were on our way. Almost stayed a night in Vegas too but we got there so late we couldn't find a hotel. We finally got to San Francisco and ended up staying a week or two before I flew back to Indiana, got my car, and returned to my college campus to sleep on my friend's couch. Then I headed down to Louisville to see my girlfriend for a few days and I left my car there when I got another flight.\n\n-----\n\nWhy another flight? Well a friend I made on StartupBus had gotten some weed while we were in Colorado and had become progressively more insane by the time we were in San Francisco. While we were there he suddenly decided to rent a car and drive back to Colorado to see a girl he had met in a mall we stopped at in the middle of nowhere. He got pulled over going something like 140mph and the car got impounded. So to get the car back to the company (they're only in San Fran), I took a plane to Salt Lake City and then got a ride to Delta, Utah. I un-impounded the car, an Audi A8, and drove it all the way back to San Francisco. Then finally got a flight back from SF to Indiana where I was supposed to take Megabus back to Louisville but it never came.

I am an outgoing and aspiring writer, blogger, and adventurer. By 2020 I wish to be a published author. I have carried around my bucket list in my wallet for 7 years since my senior year of high school. After all these years, I am beginning to check off some of the things. Motivated and Eager should be my middle name instead of June! Concert tickets have been bought, plane tickets and hotel rooms have been booked, and trail maps have been printed, highlighted, and laminated. Studying has also begun! From researching how to travel with a child, to proper hiking boots, to managing finances, and efficient ways to document it all for writing purposes, I have had my brain on overload. I've also been working my tail off and raising my kiddo to the best of my ability while trying to learn all the crucial facts for my adventures. She comes first always but for my more strenuous activities a sitter, aka my mom, has been booked. I'm currently playing the waiting game until the rain lets up so I can go explore Mudlick Hollow. It's a simple local trail, buts it's said to be haunted by a young man and his new wife who both died in a tragic carriage accident centuries ago. It's rumored to be one of the saddest trails to hike in Pennsylvania. After that comes a 13 mile day trip to Raccoon Creek State Park with my coworker Ashley. We've mapped our trail route, got our gear, and are rearing to go once the weather breaks. Once March rolls around, Stevie Nicks, Here I come!!! For Christmas, my better half purchased my mother and I tickets to attend her concert in Pittsburgh. After that, kayaking season begins and I will already be three things less on my bucket list. I will also have gained three more blog entries! 2017 is going to be full of action, wonder, and amazement for me. I have a cheering section behind me this year and nothing will get in my way. Support, well wishes, and any advice for my expeditions are well appreciated. If you would like to follow my journey I will provide the link to my blog.

If you did it nonstop I suppose that could possibly scratch your itch for adventure. I doubt it though. ", "When I was 17 right after school I left home to hike the appalachian trail.  I didn't thru hike the whole thing at the time but just went out there to have an adventure, and boy did that change my life.  You're still young but maybe try some overnight trips to places.  Hiking trips, river trips, road trips, whatever floats your boat.  You'll find out real quick what drives you.", "I wasnt going for depressed I just remember wanting the same thing at 15 and tried many things like biking the blue ridge parkway , going to Alaska, being a whitewater rafting guide and can say for me at least those feel adventurous but they don't feel like a real adventure. I think the desire for real adventure is part of transitioning into a man that is a common theme in movies and games and that's what boys are taught because they relate to that and in real life where everything dangerous is illegal and even something like sky diving that's scary is controlled chaos which will never feel like a real adventure. ", "Ok, I feel I am the best equipped to answer this question for you. I was 15 at the time and I had same problem, I wanted adventure. I found someone who liked to climb so I figured why not. It's perfect for adrenaline. Just last weekend, we were up at devels lake wisconsin climbing on our own. Climbing is great you find routes, make your own, and have fun looking for new places to climb. I am now 16 and I can drive so I'm going up to wisconsin over spring break and we are gonna backpack up there. Your whole world opens up when you can drive. ", "\nCheck out NOLS! Best thing I did as a 16 year old... ", "this is actually a perfect response. Plus you'll probably learn to dirt bag making traveling cheaper. \nI'd second it with start saving money. Maybe find a job that helps you adventure or just anything that lets you save so when you're older and able to make more choices you won't tell yourself that you're too broke. Something will always get in the way of your adventures if you let it: too young, school, too poor,need to work on your career. But if you make it a priority, you will make it happen. \nLook into summer/semester/year exchange programs. Research gap programs once you graduate HS or research traveling cheaply as the gap programs can be really expensive.

If cash is given to you, it won't reach the cause.  \n\nFinding a good route is very difficult if you intend to walk every bit of the route, especially from San Diego.  Just finding a decent route can take up a surprisingly big part of your day.  It's better if you start up north and take the bike touring route.\n\nIt'd help a lot to have a support vehicle to bring you food and water, especially water in the south west in the summer.

They're soft, light, and dry quickly. He/she's totally right about the smell though. They absorb your funk quickly, requiring you to wash them out a couple times a week in camp. I would put cotton as the least ideal material. It's heavy, doesn't breath or wick as well as the other materials, and once it gets wet it will stay cold and wet (and even heavier) for what seems like an eternity. \n\nTo get from San Diego to Denver, consider the Old Spanish National Historic Trail. Might be a winding, but useful, route. You can jump off at I70.\n\nSince you'll be going at least partially through the SW, carry lots of water - you'll need to stay hydrated and water sources are much more scarce than in the eastern states.

My electronics include my iphone, solar charger, public libraries, and helpful people along the way. \n\nWater is a huge concern as some areas are about 90 miles between reliable sources in the dessert. Where going through 2 gallons a day isn't unusual to stay hydrated. At 20 miles a day that would be 7-8 gallons. Carrying about 60 pounds of water would be insane on top of a full pack of gear and food. So I'm going to push it in a cart or stroller.

It smells a lot less, still dries quickly, and it's more presentable.  How you smell will make a big difference when you talk to people and even the press.  I did a walk that had a lot in common to what you're attempting to do, and polyester was a big mistake.  I washed it every day, sometimes several times a day, but it quickly becomes an impossible situation.  Polyester works fine as a pure backpacker where no one is around to smell me, but it was awful for a walk where the goal is to get attention in a good way.  It was a good thing I was in a group.  Lonehiker thinks polyester is okay, but he's coming from a perspective of a thru hiker (backpacker), and he doesn't like being around people on his hikes. \n\nYou should be able to get water more often than 90 miles.  Most days you'll only drink around a gallon.  On my hottest toughest days, I've never drank more than 10 liters.   Show me your route if you had one.  I probably walked part of it and can tell you about resources along the way.  \n\nI still think doing a bike route is the way to go.  It's a proven route for people travelling without a vehicle.  Starting from San Diego has so many problems.  It might work out, but the logistics are daunting, and you still rely on luck.  I've seen a couple walkers that had to skip big portions southwestern states because the law enforcement would pick them.  There's no where to walk but freeways, and even though it's supposed to be legal when there's no walkable substitute, that doesn't stop law enforcement from getting you off the freeway.  That's why I asked if it's a big deal to walk every mile.  [Here's the route](http://www.rayjardine.com/adventures/2010-TransAm/index.htm) I'm recommending.  If I ever tried walking coast to coast again, I'd do this route.\n\nIf you can actually do 20 miles a day, you'll do okay.  At least you're your only limitation.  20 miles a day is actually pretty easy if all you're doing is walking.  It's mostly about time management.  That can be tough to do in an activism walk though if you're stopping in towns to talk to people, using a good cell connection to plan your trip and do your business online, and there will also probably be people that will see you and offer you a place to sleep.  While getting a place to sleep and eat sounds great, especially on a long walk, it kills a lot of walking time.\n\nYour cell phone is useful, but keep in mind that your data connection won't work well once you get past Riverside.  It's good to see you're not getting bogged down with pounds and pounds of electronics.\n\nYou can sort of get away with sleeping on public property and churches. Private property can get you into trouble if you don't get permission and sometimes you'll be able to get permission, but some property owners will get upset even if you camp along the shoulder outside of their fence. \n\nI think you'll actually have it easier in a lot of ways since your solo.

Coincidentally, I was packing my tent away (in Cumbria) at the time and the irony of dreading more tourism whilst being a tourist wasn't lost on me.  \n\nCumbria ought to be preserved and 'sacralised' and yet it needs an economy and therein lies all the potential problems; nobody wants Ennerdale to become like Windermere. I presume you and I are both seekers of beauty and isolation even if you're, by far, the more committed.

Must have been spectacular. Really glad you enjoyed the article. Wainwright is indeed a fine writer, countless passages of his capture the landscape so beautifully.\n\nI know that irony all too well. The desire to walk the fells but also to want them all to ourselves. There are plenty of Lakeland peaks that don\u2019t get heavy footfall, though. Scafell is one, actually. The crowds all climb Scafell Pike but miss out its neighbour. Lingmell is another. The crowds pass within a stone\u2019s throw of its summit on the way up to the Pike, but few make the detour.

The idea is to cycle the 300km (180 miles) all along the coast. \n\nWhile 300km (180 miles) is doable in one day for someone with little training, the plan here is to enjoy the trip and other's company, spending more time on the beaches than on the bike, camping along the way.\n\nThe plan is also to plan as little as possible. No expectations of how many km we'll do per say. Maybe we don't even get to the Algarve, don't really care so long as everyone's having fun. Literally wake up and decide as a group what we'll be doing that day. And if we get to the Algarve and have a few days left? There's always going back to Lisbon or heading in Spain's direction :)\n\nUnderstand that this is not an endurance ride, the idea is that this should be doable by everyone and it's more about the comradeship than the actual trip. It's about the camping, the cycling and the spending time at the beach with people exactly that.\n\nThere will be a van involved to carry tents, backpacks etc as well, obviously, if someone is a bit too tired to cycle they can pop their bike on the van and go on the van as well. Unless someone wants to offer, we'll take turns driving the van.\n\nWhether you bring your own bike or rent one for the days in Portugal completely up to you!

A 4 day trip to Pisgah National Forest costs us about $90-110 in gas, $25 for food, and a few bucks for coffee shop WiFi and drinks. Here are 5 tips for adventures on a budget."]}, {"title": "We lived on a boat in the city centre of Rotterdam.", "body": "", "id": "79662q", "image": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-u6AuoQr3g", "num_comments": 2, "link": "/r/adventures/comments/79662q/we_lived_on_a_boat_in_the_city_centre_of_rotterdam/", "upvotes": 7, "comments": ["It looks like you haven't made a top level comment explaining the background details of this adventure ([rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventures/about/rules/)).

Wooohoo :) I like this subreddit here! In the video, we're travelling from germany munich to rotterdam in the netherlands. We stayed on a boat for four nights. The owner of the boat purchased it about 10 years ago and it's really in the centre of rotterdam. It has a size of 2000 square meters inside and a beautiful deck. We didn't used the public transportation once while our time in rotterdam, that's how centre the boat was. If you like good food, nice architecture, coffeeshops and a city that is not ran over by tourists you should definitely go to Rotterdam once. If you are interested in staying on the boat too, just text me and i'll give you all the information you need! Wish you guys a nice weekend!"]}, {"title": "Hey guys, I got a chance to visit Smith Rock. You should check it out!

We weren't planning on stopping by Smith Rock, but our adventure led us here. Oregon was/is being affected by the Eagle Creek (?) fire and so it canceled one of our original plans.
